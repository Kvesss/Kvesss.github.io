        <h3>KING</h3>
        <br>
        The king (♔,♚) is the most important piece in the game of chess. In algebraic notation,
        the king is abbreviated in English by the letter K. If a player's king is threatened with
        capture, it is said to be in check, and the player must remove the threat of capture on
        the next move. If this cannot be done, the king is said to be in checkmate, resulting
        in a loss for that player. Players cannot make any move that places their own king in
        check. Although the king is the most important piece, it is one of the weakest pieces
        in the game outside of the endgame.<br><br>
        A king can move one square in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally),
         unless the square is already occupied by a friendly piece, or the move would place the
          king in check. As a result, opposing kings may never occupy adjacent squares
           (see opposition) to give check, as that would put the moving king in check as well.
            However, the king can give discovered check by unblocking a bishop, rook, or queen.
             The king is also involved in the special move of castling.<br><br>
             <h4>CASTLING</h4>
             <br>
             The king can make a special move, in conjunction with a rook, called castling.
              When castling, the king moves two squares toward one of its rooks, and that 
              rook is placed on the square over which the king crossed.
                Castling is permissible only when:
                <ul class="castling">
                    <li>neither the king nor the castling rook have previously moved</li>
                    <li>no squares between them are occupied</li>
                    <li>the king is not in check</li>
                    <li>none of the squares the king would move across or to are under enemy attack</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                Castling with the h-file rook is known as castling kingside or short castling,
                     while castling with the a-file rook is known as castling queenside or long castling.

        <h3>QUEEN</h3>
        <br>
        The queen (♕, ♛) is the most powerful piece in the game of chess, able to move any
         number of squares vertically, horizontally or diagonally. Each player starts the game
          with one queen, placed in the middle of the first rank next to the king. Because the
           queen is the strongest piece, a pawn is promoted to a queen in the vast majority of cases.
           <br><br>
           The white queen starts on d1, while the black queen starts on d8. With the chessboard
            oriented correctly, the white queen starts on a white square and the black queen
             starts on a black square.The queen can be moved any number of unoccupied squares
             in a straight line vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, thus combining the
              moves of the rook and bishop. The queen captures by occupying the square on
               which an enemy piece sits.
