        <h3>KING</h3>
        <br>
        The king (♔,♚) is the most important piece in the game of chess. In algebraic notation,
        the king is abbreviated in English by the letter K. If a player's king is threatened with
        capture, it is said to be in check, and the player must remove the threat of capture on
        the next move. If this cannot be done, the king is said to be in checkmate, resulting
        in a loss for that player. Players cannot make any move that places their own king in
        check. Although the king is the most important piece, it is one of the weakest pieces
        in the game outside of the endgame.<br><br>
        A king can move one square in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally),
         unless the square is already occupied by a friendly piece, or the move would place the
          king in check. As a result, opposing kings may never occupy adjacent squares
           (see opposition) to give check, as that would put the moving king in check as well.
            However, the king can give discovered check by unblocking a bishop, rook, or queen.
             The king is also involved in the special move of castling.<br><br>
             <h4>CASTLING</h4>
             <br>
             The king can make a special move, in conjunction with a rook, called castling.
              When castling, the king moves two squares toward one of its rooks, and that 
              rook is placed on the square over which the king crossed.
                Castling is permissible only when:
                <ul class="castling">
                    <li>neither the king nor the castling rook have previously moved</li>
                    <li>no squares between them are occupied</li>
                    <li>the king is not in check</li>
                    <li>none of the squares the king would move across or to are under enemy attack</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                Castling with the h-file rook is known as castling kingside or short castling,
                     while castling with the a-file rook is known as castling queenside or long castling.

        <h3>QUEEN</h3>
        <br>
        The queen (♕, ♛) is the most powerful piece in the game of chess, able to move any
         number of squares vertically, horizontally or diagonally. Each player starts the game
          with one queen, placed in the middle of the first rank next to the king. Because the
           queen is the strongest piece, a pawn is promoted to a queen in the vast majority of cases.
           <br><br>
           The white queen starts on d1, while the black queen starts on d8. With the chessboard
            oriented correctly, the white queen starts on a white square and the black queen
             starts on a black square.The queen can be moved any number of unoccupied squares
             in a straight line vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, thus combining the
              moves of the rook and bishop. The queen captures by occupying the square on
               which an enemy piece sits.<br><br>
               Pawn promotion to a queen is colloquially called queening, which is by far
                the most common type of piece a pawn is promoted to due to the relative
                 power of a queen.

        <h3>ROOK</h3>
        <br>
        The rook (♖,♜) is a piece in the game of chess resembling a castle. Formerly the
         piece (from Persian رخ rokh/rukh), meaning chariot, was alternatively called the
          tower, marquess, rector, and comes. The term castle is considered to be informal,
           incorrect, or old-fashioned. Each player starts the game with two rooks,
            one on each of the corner squares on their own side of the board.
           <br><br>
           The white rooks start on squares a1 and h1, while the black rooks start
            on a8 and h8. The rook moves horizontally or vertically, through any number
             of unoccupied squares. As with captures by other pieces, the rook captures
              by occupying the square on which the enemy piece sits. The rook also
               participates, with the king, in a special move called castling.
               <br><br>
               In general, rooks are stronger than bishops or knights (which are called minor pieces)
                and are considered greater in value than either of those pieces by nearly two pawns
                 but less valuable than two minor pieces by approximately a pawn.
                  Two rooks are generally considered to be worth slightly more than a queen.<br>
                   Winning a rook for a bishop or knight is referred to as winning the exchange. 
                   Rooks and queens are called heavy pieces or major pieces, as opposed to 
                   bishops and knights, the minor pieces.

    <article class="bishop" id="bishop">
        <h3>BISHOP</h3>
        <br>
        The bishop (♗,♝) is a piece in the game of chess. Each player begins the game with
         two bishops. One starts between the king's knight and the king, the other between
          the queen's knight and the queen. The starting squares are c1 and f1 for
           White's bishops, and c8 and f8 for Black's bishops.<br><br>
           The bishop has no restrictions in distance for each move, but is limited to
            diagonal movement. Bishops, like all other pieces except the knight, cannot
             jump over other pieces. A bishop captures by occupying the square on which
              an enemy piece sits. The bishops may be differentiated according to which
               wing they begin on, i.e. the king's bishop and queen's bishop. As a
                consequence of its diagonal movement, each bishop always remains on
                 either the white or black squares, and so it is also common to refer
                  to them as light-squared or dark-squared bishops.<br><br>
                  A rook is generally worth about two pawns more than a bishop. 
                  The bishop has access to only half of the squares on the board, 
                  whereas all squares of the board are accessible to the rook.<br>
                  In general bishops are approximately equal in strength to knights,
                    but depending on the game situation either may have a distinct advantage.

    <article class="knight" id="knight">
        <h3>KNIGHT</h3>
        <br>
        The knight (♘,♞) is a piece in the game of chess and is represented by a horse's
         head and neck. Each player starts with two knights, which are located between
         the rooks and bishops in the standard starting position.<br><br>
         Compared to other chess pieces, the knight's movement is unique: it may move
          two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally
           and one square vertically (with both forming the shape of an L). While moving,
            the knight can jump over pieces to reach its destination. Knights capture in
             the same way, replacing the enemy piece on the square and removing it from
              the board. Knights and pawns are the only pieces that can be moved in the
               initial position.<br><br>
         The knight is colloquially sometimes referred to as a "horse", which is also
          the translation of the piece's name in several languages. Some languages
           refer to it as the "jumper", reflecting the knight's ability to move over
            pieces in its path.<br><br>
            Knights and bishops, also known as minor pieces, are considered approximately
             equal in value. Bishops utilize a longer range, but can only move to squares
              of one color. The knight's value increases in closed positions since it can
               jump over blockades. Knights and bishops are stronger when supported by 
               other pieces (such as pawns) to create outposts and become more powerful
                when they advance, as long as they remain active.

    <article class="pawn" id="pawn">
        <h3>PAWN</h3>
        <br>
        The pawn (♙,♟) is the most numerous piece in the game of chess and, in most circumstances,
         also the weakest. It historically represents infantry, or more particularly, armed peasants
          or pikemen. Each player begins a game with eight pawns, one on each square of the rank immediately
           in front of the other pieces. (The white pawns start on a2, b2, c2, d2, e2, f2, g2, h2;
            the black pawns start on a7, b7, c7, d7, e7, f7, g7, h7.)<br><br>
            Unlike the other pieces, pawns cannot move backwards. Normally a pawn moves by advancing a
             single square, but the first time a pawn moves, it has the option of advancing two squares.
              Pawns may not use the initial two-square advance to jump over an occupied square, or to 
              capture. Any piece immediately in front of a pawn, friend or foe, blocks its advance. 
              In the second diagram, the pawn on c4 can move to c5; the pawn on e2 can move to 
              either e3 or e4.<br><br>
              Unlike other pieces, the pawn does not capture in the same direction that it moves.
               A pawn captures diagonally forward one square to the left or right.<br><br>
               <h4>EN PASSANT</h4>
               <br>
               En passant (French: [ɑ̃ paˈsɑ̃], lit. in passing) is a move in chess. It is a special
               pawn capture that can only occur immediately after a pawn makes a move of two squares
               from its starting square, and it could have been captured by an enemy pawn had it advanced
                only one square. The opponent captures the just-moved pawn "as it passes" through the first
                 square. The result is the same as if the pawn had advanced only one square and the enemy
                  pawn had captured it normally.<br>
                  The en passant capture must be made on the very next turn or the right to do so is lost.
                  <br><br>
                  <h4>PAWN PROMOTION</h4>
                  <br>
                  is a rule that requires a pawn that reaches the eighth rank to be replaced by the player's
                   choice of a bishop, knight, rook, or queen of the same color. The piece chosen cannot
                    be another king nor another pawn. The new piece replaces the pawn on its square on the 
                    same move. The choice of the new piece is not limited to pieces previously captured,
                     thus promotion can result in a player owning, for example, two or more queens
                      despite starting the game with one.<br><br>
                      Pawn promotion, or the threat of it, often decides the result in an endgame.
                       Since the queen is the most powerful piece, the vast majority of promotions
                        are to a queen. Promotion to a queen is also called queening; promotion to
                         any other piece is referred to as underpromotion.
