        <h3>SETUP</h3>
        <br>
        Chess is an abstract strategy game and involves no hidden information.
         It is played on a square chessboard with 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid.<br>

          At the start, each player (one controlling the white pieces, the other controlling
           the black pieces) controls sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks,
            two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The object of the game is to checkmate
             the opponent's king, whereby the king is under immediate attack (in "check")
              and there is no way to remove it from attack on the next move.
               There are also several ways a game can end in a draw.<br>

        <h3>RULES</h3>
        <br>
        White moves first, after which players alternate turns, moving one piece per turn (except for castling,
         when two pieces are moved). A piece is moved to either an unoccupied square or one occupied by an
          opponent's piece, which is captured and removed from play. With the sole exception of en passant,
           all pieces capture by moving to the square that the opponent's piece occupies.<br>
Moving is compulsory; it is illegal to skip a turn, even when having to move is detrimental. A player may not
 make any move that would put or leave the player's own king in check. If the player to move has no legal move,
  the game is over; the result is either checkmate (a loss for the player with no legal move)
   if the king is in check, or stalemate (a draw) if the king is not.<br>
If players wish to adjust a piece on the board, they must first say J'adoube (I adjust) or the equivalent.
 Apart from that, if a piece is touched it must be moved or captured if possible (the 'touch and move' rule). 
 Similarly if a move is finished, it must not be taken back.
Each piece has its own way of moving. In the diagrams, the dots mark the squares to which the piece can move
 if there are no intervening piece(s) of either color (except the knight, which leaps over any intervening pieces).

    <article class="check">
        <h3>CHECK</h3>
        <br>
        When a king is under immediate attack by one or two of the opponent's pieces, it is said to be in check.
         A move in response to a check is legal only if it results in a position where the king is no longer
          in check. This can involve capturing the checking piece; interposing a piece between the checking
           piece and the king (which is possible only if the attacking piece is a queen, rook, or bishop and
            there is a square between it and the king); or moving the king to a square where it is not under attack.
             Castling is not a permissible response to a check.
            The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent; this occurs when the opponent's king is in check,
             and there is no legal way to remove it from attack. It is never legal for a player to make a move
              that puts or leaves the player's own king in check.
