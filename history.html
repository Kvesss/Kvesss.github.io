        <h3>Beginnings</h3>
        <br>
        Chess is believed to have originated in northwest India, by about the early 7th century.
         Its early form was known as chaturaṅga (Sanskrit: चतुरङ्ग), literally four divisions 
         [of the military] – infantry, cavalry, elephants, and chariotry, represented by the
          pieces that would evolve into the modern pawn, knight, bishop, and rook, respectively.<br><br>
          The oldest archaeological chess artifacts, ivory pieces, were excavated in ancient Afrasiab,
           today's Samarkand, in Uzbekistan, Central Asia, and date to about 760, with some of them
            possibly older. The oldest known chess manual was in Arabic and dates to 840–850, 
            written by al-Adli ar-Rumi (800–870), a renowned Arab chess player, titled Kitab 
            ash-shatranj (Book of the chess). <br><br>
            The game reached Western Europe and Russia by at least three routes, the earliest
             being in the 9th century. By the year 1000, it had spread throughout both Muslim
              Iberia and Latin Europe.[38] A Latin poem de scachis dated to the late 10th century
               has been preserved in Einsiedeln Abbey. A famous 13th-century manuscript covering
                chess, backgammon, and dice is known as the Libro de los juegos.<br><br>

        <h3>2nd Millennium</h3>
        <br>
        Around 1475, several major changes made the game essentially as it is known today. These 
        modern rules for the basic moves had been adopted in Italy and Spain. Pawns gained
         the option of advancing two squares on their first move, while bishops and queens acquired
          their modern abilities. The queen replaced the earlier vizier chess piece towards the end
           of the 10th century and by the 15th century had become the most powerful piece; 
           consequently, modern chess was referred to as "Queen's Chess" or "Mad Queen Chess".<br>
            Castling, derived from the "kings leap" usually in combination with a pawn or rook move
             to bring the king to safety, was introduced. These new rules quickly spread throughout
              western Europe.<br><br>
              The rules concerning stalemate were finalized in the early 19th century.
               Also in the 19th century, the convention that White moves first was established
                (formerly either White or Black could move first). Finally, the rules around
                 castling were standardized – variations in the castling rules had persisted in
                  Italy until the late 19th century.<br> The resulting standard game is sometimes
                   referred to as Western chess or international chess, particularly in
                    Asia where other games of the chess family such as xiangqi are prevalent.
                     Since the 19th century, the only rule changes have been technical in nature,
                      for example establishing the correct procedure for claiming a draw by repetition.<br><br>
                       As the 19th century progressed, chess organization developed quickly.Many chess clubs,
                        chess books, and chess journals appeared.Chess problems became a regular part of 
                        19th-century newspapers; Bernhard Horwitz, Josef Kling, and Samuel Loyd
                         composed some of the most influential problems. In 1843, von der Lasa published
                          his and Bilguer's Handbuch des Schachspiels (Handbook of Chess), 
                          the first comprehensive manual of chess theory.The first modern chess
                           tournament was organized by Howard Staunton, a leading English chess
                            player, and was held in London in 1851. It was won by the German Adolf
                             Anderssen, who was hailed as the leading chess master.<br><br>
                             Prague-born Wilhelm Steinitz laid foundations for the scientific
                              approach to the game, the art to break a position down into its
                               components and prepare correct plans. In addition to his theoretical achievements,
                                Steinitz founded an important tradition: his triumph over the leading German
                                 master Johannes Zukertort in 1886 is regarded as the first official World Chess
                                  Championship. Steinitz lost his crown in 1894 to a much younger player,
                                   the German mathematician Emanuel Lasker, who maintained this title for 27 years,
                                    the longest tenure of any world champion.<br><br>

        <h3>Modern game</h3>
        <br>
        After the end of the 19th century, the number of master tournaments and matches held annually
         quickly grew. The first Olympiad was held in Paris in 1924, and FIDE was founded initially
          for the purpose of organizing that event. In 1927, the Women's World Chess Championship was
           established; the first to hold the title was Czech-English master Vera Menchik.A prodigy
            from Cuba, José Raúl Capablanca, known for his skill in endgames, won the World Championship
             from Lasker in 1921. Capablanca was undefeated in tournament play for eight years, from 1916 to 1924.<br><br>
             Between the world wars, chess was revolutionized by the new theoretical school of so-called
              hypermodernists like Aron Nimzowitsch and Richard Réti. They advocated controlling the center
               of the board with distant pieces rather than with pawns, thus inviting opponents to occupy
                the center with pawns, which become objects of attack.<br><br>
                Russian Mikhail Botvinnik started an era of Soviet dominance in the chess world.
                 Until the end of the Soviet Union, there was only one non-Soviet champion,
                  American Bobby Fischer (champion 1972–1975). Botvinnik revolutionized opening theory.
                   Previously Black strove for equality, to neutralize White's first-move advantage.<br>
                   In the previous informal system of World Championships, the current champion 
                   decided which challenger he would play for the title and the challenger was 
                   forced to seek sponsors for the match. FIDE set up a new system of qualifying 
                   tournaments and matches. The world's strongest players were seeded into Interzonal 
                   tournaments, where they were joined by players who had qualified from Zonal tournaments.<br><br>
                   Russian grandmaster Anatoly Karpov dominated the 1970s and early 1980s with a string of tournament 
                   successes.Karpov's reign finally ended in 1985 at the hands of Garry Kasparov, another
                    Soviet player from Baku, Azerbaijan. Kasparov and Karpov contested five world title matches
                     between 1984 and 1990.<br><br>
                     Kasparov lost his Classical title in 2000 to Vladimir Kramnik of Russia. The World Chess
                      Championship 2006, in which Kramnik beat the FIDE World Champion Veselin Topalov, reunified 
                      the titles and made Kramnik the undisputed World Chess Champion. In September 2007,
                       he lost the title to Viswanathan Anand of India, who won the championship tournament in
                        Mexico City. Anand defended his title in the revenge match of 2008, 2010 and 2012. In 2013,
                         Magnus Carlsen of Norway beat Anand in the 2013 World Chess Championship and is the reigning
                         world champion.<br><br>
